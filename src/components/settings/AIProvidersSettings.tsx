/* ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   AI Providers design system — a locally-scoped token block, PI-style.

   WHAT IS AND IS NOT PANEL-LOCAL (revised — the CONTAINER LAYER now aliases
   the app-wide tokens):

     The CARD is `--bg-item-surface` behind a `--border-subtle` edge, in both
     themes. That is the exact pair every card in this panel carried at
     3e8ea9fa, and it is theme-invariant as an EXPRESSION — the split lives in
     the token (#27272A dark / #EAECEF light; transparent dark / 7% black
     light), so it is declared once and cannot drift per theme.

     A previous pass aliased the card to General's dark container instead
     (`bg-transparent`). That is only survivable on General because every
     General card holds a SINGLE ROW: the row's own content is the object, so
     the container may be notional. These cards are multi-row structured
     objects — header + key field + action row + a nested disclosure — and
     without a fill they degraded into hollow outlines with no surface. The
     card here must be a real surface; General's dark transparency is not a
     portable rule.

     The WELL — the layer BELOW a card — is a black wash rather than a flat
     token, because it has to read as recessed against THREE different parents:
     a card, the page canvas, and (for the cURL examples) another well. A flat
     value can only be correct against one of them; an alpha compounds down the
     stack automatically. See the note above ".aip-well".

     Everything BELOW the container — buttons, inputs, the field shell, chips,
     badges, the switch, text roles — stays `--aip-*`. Those need a translucent
     compositing hairline that no Tailwind pair produces: in dark
     `--border-subtle` is literally `transparent` (src/index.css:84) and the
     only visible border token is `--border-muted` (#333, opaque, far heavier
     than a hairline), so a control built on them is either edgeless or heavy.

   `--border-subtle` is NOT changed globally: dozens of other components were
   built against a transparent value.

   The accent is ALIASED, not re-declared per theme: this panel renders inside
   `[data-settings-theme="periwinkle"]` (SettingsOverlay.tsx) where
   `--accent-primary` already resolves to periwinkle-300 dark / periwinkle-600 light.
   `--text-danger` is reused for the same reason (it is already theme-split
   because one red cannot clear 4.5:1 on both fills).

   Tailwind is still used for LAYOUT only inside `.aip-root`. Colour comes from
   `var(--aip-*)`.

   Motion is CSS-only — deliberately no framer-motion in this file. Animations
   stay off the main thread, which matters because this renderer also hosts the
   always-on-top overlay and a 3s Ollama poll.

/* ── Surfaces. The container is rounded-xl + --bg-item-surface +
      --border-subtle, which is the pair every card in this panel carried at
      3e8ea9fa, restored verbatim.

      It is NOT General's dark container. General's is bg-transparent +
      border-transparent, and a pass that copied that here produced hollow
      outlines: General can drop both the fill AND the edge because every one of
      its cards holds a single row, so the row IS the object and the container
      is free to be notional. A provider card is a heading row plus a credential
      row plus an action row plus a nested models disclosure. Four rows with
      nothing behind them do not read as one object — they read as a skeleton,
      and two adjacent skeletons merge into an undifferentiated block. The fill
      is what makes a multi-row card a card; it is not optional here.

      The edge then goes back to --border-subtle, i.e. transparent in dark. With
      the fill restored, a white hairline would encode the same boundary twice
      over a 9-step lift and a 12px radius. In light, --border-subtle is a real
      7% black and does separate work, because the light fill sits BELOW its
      canvas rather than above it. One token, correct in both, by construction.

      Note what General's dark divider really computes to: the
      "divide-border-subtle/20" it asks for emits NO CSS at all (Tailwind 3
      cannot recompute alpha on a bare var() colour — same trap documented at
      src/index.css:63 and tailwind.config.js:23), so its separators fall back
      to preflight's #e5e7eb. Deliberately not reproduced: an authored
      near-white hairline on a #1E1E21 canvas is a bug to inherit, not a
      grammar to match. Dividers here use --aip-divider.

      No box-shadow. General has none in either theme, and the pair this rule
      used to carry never rendered anyway: "box-shadow" is "none | <shadow>#",
      so both "inset 0 1px 0 rgba(...), none" (dark) and "none, 0 1px 1px
      rgba(...)" (light) were invalid declarations and were dropped whole.

      This is not a two-state toggle on one element: it is a single exclusive
      property MOVING between rows. Two rows change at once, arbitrarily far apart,
      and either may be scrolled out of a 216px well.

      So only the ARRIVING badge animates. Three reasons:
        - The row you clicked is the one you are looking at; it is the only place
          feedback is legible.
        - The departing row is frequently off-screen, and animating something
          invisible buys nothing. By the time you scroll to it the animation is
          long over, so it would only ever be seen having already finished.
        - A row quietly GAINING a "Set default" ghost is not something you did.
          Animating it would claim an event that never happened.

 * The model allow-list: a summary row that discloses a vertical list.
 *
 * One control from n=2 to n=70. What changes with size is whether the well
 * scrolls and whether a filter appears — never what the control *is*.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a modal or popover. Portals are forbidden in this file
 * (SettingsPeriwinklePortalScopeGuard) because the design tokens resolve by DOM
 * ancestry, and `overflow-y:auto` on the settings scroller computes `overflow-x`
 * to `auto`, making it a clip box on both axes — a floating layer on a lower card
 * opens into clipped space.
 *
 * Chips were the previous control. They work at n=3 and fail at n=70: a wrapped
 * wall, one tab stop per chip, and flex-wrap reflow that moves a click target
 * between aim and click.

                Motion matches the Plans & Billing tier switcher: the selection is
                one absolutely-positioned pill translated across a fixed-width

                compositor. The tabs themselves never restyle their background —
                which is what stops the four-way colour swap that a per-button
                `bg` transition produces. */}

                    extend transitionDuration), so it is dropped and
